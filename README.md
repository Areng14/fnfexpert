# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine

**Psych Engine**, originally used in the [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), was created as an improvement over the vanilla version of **Friday Night Funkin'**, addressing numerous issues while maintaining the casual gameplay aspect. This engine is also designed to be more accessible for beginner coders.

## Psych Engine with Expert Mode Added
This modification introduces an **Expert Mode** which is designed to offer a more challenging experience compared to the standard modes.
